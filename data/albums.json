The songs are all rich in composition but intentionally fragmented and disjointed in their production, channeling the familiar and the alien perfectly. When this is mixed with Harris' strong lyrics and powerful vocals, the combination is compelling and fascinating and stands out exceptionally among this year's best records.\" - Brainwashed.com\n\n\"Comprised from the ground up from samples of manipulated objects: pill bottles, keys jangling, the scrape of mic on wood, these familiar sounds are processed and brought into congregation with lushly composed electro-acoustic arrangements that move from harsh-noise informed blasts to delicate electronic passages… compositions that effortlessly fold in found-sound manipulation with a straightforward pop paradigm… The intersections of physical violence and sexual identity. Family secrets and call-out culture. Brutally honest survivor perspectives and trigger warnings. \"Shifting Weight\" wades in those murky waters out of necessity. It is easily one of the most powerful songs of 2016. That can be said about the remainder of the album.\" - Tometotheweathermachine.com  \ncredits\nReleased September 28, 2016"

    "notes": "EPZERO is a slowly evolving and sometimes intense work that stylistically alludes to early Komische and Berlin-School recordings in its prominent use of process, arpeggiated sequences, and minimal rhythms to generate cosmic soundscapes. Unlike the aforementioned predecessors, the E.P. maintains an emphasis on modern electro, downtempo, and hip hop beats which impart a familiar and contemporary feel to the record. Embracing noise and the punk aesthetic, EPZERO belongs more in the primal end of the spectrum than the seemingly sterile, academic connotations that usually come with this style of music. It was recorded using analog processes in New York City.\ncredits\nReleased July 11, 2014\n\nMy Love MHz is Allan Pichardo."
