    "notes": "\"A voice magnificent and morose, lost in a world of single being in performance.\" - Experimental NYC\n\n\"He crafts coherent songs out of abstract processes and R&B from the tools of noise with the assured vision of an expert… a thrilling melange of found sound and pop music.\"\n- Experimedia\n\n\"This is soul music functioning as 21st century meditation. Jason Anthony Harris has taken the defining objects of our modern age, and imported hidden meaning to their status. ...Public Speaking is what happens when an artist personally realizes the sound of his environment, and puts it to use. ...Experience the intimate soul croon of Public Speaking.\" - The Deli NYC"

    "notes": "As the musical identity of digital artist Allan Pichardo, My Love MHz creates minimal electronic music that is as equally influenced by modern digital culture as it is by the Krautrock and Berlin-school electronic artists of the 70's. It is founded on the idea that even in the precise, cold, calculative world of computer music, tribal rhythms and emotions are undeniably emergent."

    "notes": "Madam West is an NYC-based experimental pop quintet. Originating as a synth-pop duo in a musty Bushwick basement, the group has grown into a five-piece fusing alt-rock, folk and neosoul influences into a layered and danceable sound wholly their own.\n\nThe group has been favorably reviewed in IMPOSE, Tiny Mix Tapes, GoldFlakePaint, NextNorthWest, and Bearded (UK) and embarked on their first national tour in Spring 2017. Madam West has opened for Anna Wise (Grammy winner for Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp A Butterfly) and shared festival bills with artists the likes of Milo, Guerrilla Toss and Zola Jesus."
